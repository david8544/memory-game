# Memory Scramble

This project is an online multiplier memory game. Like any other memory game, the players are shown a set of cards 
and need to find the different mathching once the cards are covered. There are no turns, any player can choose cards
at the same time.

### what this shows?

Locking, synchronization, and I'd say very non-robust nor convenient server implemenation in Java. If I had to do it again, I would probably
leave the game implementation as is, but will change the server to spring. In addition, please view all the testing implemented under the testing folder, by this you will be able to see the different test-cases, edge-cases, I thought of while implementing the system.
